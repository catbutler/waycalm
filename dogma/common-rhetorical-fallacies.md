title: Common fallacies that impede rational enquiry
description: Edited version of Carl Sagan's list of fallacies commonly used to undermine rational enquiry.
---

Carl Sagan produced a "baloney detection kit" for people who wish to pursue science. Source: [The Baloney Detection Kit: Carl Sagan’s Rules for Bullshit-Busting and Critical Thinking](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/03/baloney-detection-kit-carl-sagan/). It's probably better if you don't know who Carl Sagan is, because then you might accept them on that basis.

This list is an edited version, made to fit Way Calm.

## Ad hominem

Latin for “to the man,” attacking the arguer and not the argument (e.g., The Reverend Dr. Smith is a known Biblical fundamentalist, so her objections to evolution need not be taken seriously).

## Argument from authority

Essentially the opposite of ad hominem.

E.g., President Richard Nixon should be re-elected because he has a secret plan to end the war in Southeast Asia — but because it was secret, there was no way for the electorate to evaluate it on its merits; the argument amounted to trusting him because he was President: a mistake, as it turned out.

## Argument from disjunct consequences

- A God meting out punishment and reward must exist, because if He didn’t, society would be much more lawless and dangerous — perhaps even ungovernable. But clearly people who behave badly sometimes gain enormous rewards, and we have a justice system despite the argument that Hell awaits sinners.
- The defendant in a widely publicized murder trial must be found guilty; otherwise, it will be an encouragement for other men to murder their wives. But the outcome of a trial should be based on guilt or innocence, and always finding people guilty would just make the justice system a way for society to mistreat people.

## Appeal to ignorance

The claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist — and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. Or: There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we’re still central to the Universe.) This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

## Special pleading

Often used to rescue a proposition in deep rhetorical trouble. Examples:

- How can a merciful God condemn future generations to torment because, against orders, one woman induced one man to eat an apple? Special plead: you don’t understand the subtle Doctrine of Free Will.
- How can there be an equally godlike Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the same Person? Special plead: You don’t understand the Divine Mystery of the Trinity.
- How could God permit the followers of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — each in their own way enjoined to heroic measures of loving kindness and compassion — to have perpetrated so much cruelty for so long? Special plead: You don’t understand Free Will again. And anyway, God moves in mysterious ways.

## Begging the question, also called assuming the answer

> [!NOTE]
> Merely evoking a question is not begging the question, unless the  question seeks proof of the answer.  

- How can we discourage violent crime? We must institute the death penalty. But does the violent crime rate in fact fall when the death penalty is imposed?
- Why did the stock market fall yesterday? Because of a technical adjustment and profit-taking by investors. But is there any independent evidence for the causal role of “adjustment” and profit-taking; have we learned anything at all from this purported explanation?

## Observational selection

Also called the enumeration of favorable circumstances, or as the philosopher Francis Bacon described it, counting the hits and forgetting the misses (e.g., A state boasts of the Presidents it has produced, but is silent on its serial killers)

## Statistics of small numbers — a close relative of observational selection

- “They say 1 out of every 5 people is Chinese. How is this possible? I know hundreds of people, and none of them is Chinese. Yours truly.”
- “I’ve thrown three sevens in a row. Tonight I can’t lose.”)

## Misunderstanding statistics

E.g., President Dwight Eisenhower expressing astonishment and alarm on discovering that fully half of all Americans have below average intelligence.

## Inconsistency

- Plan for the worst of which a potential military adversary is capable, but ignore extreme scientific projections on environmental dangers.
- Attribute the declining life expectancy in the former Soviet Union to the failures of communism many years ago, but never attribute the high infant mortality rate in the United States (now highest of the major industrial nations) to the failures of capitalism.
- Believe that the Universe will continue to exist forever into the future, but not that it has infinite duration into the past

## Non sequitur

Latin for “It doesn’t follow” (e.g., Our nation will prevail because God is great. But nearly every nation pretends this to be true; the German formulation was “Gott mit uns”). Often those falling into the non sequitur fallacy have simply failed to recognize alternative possibilities;

## Post hoc, ergo propter hoc

Latin for “It happened after, so it was caused by”

- Jaime Cardinal Sin, Archbishop of Manila: “I know of … a 26-year-old who looks 60 because she takes [contraceptive] pills.”
- Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons)

## Meaningless questions

E.g., What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? But if there is such a thing as an irresistible force there can be no immovable objects, and vice versa)

## Excluded middle, or false dichotomy

Considering only the two extremes in a continuum of intermediate possibilities.

- “Sure, take his side; my husband’s perfect; I’m always wrong.”
- “Either you love your country or you hate it.”
- “If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem”

## Short-term vs. long-term

A subset of the excluded middle, but most prevalent.

- We can’t afford programs to feed malnourished children and educate pre-school kids. We need to urgently deal with crime on the streets.
- Why explore space or pursue fundamental science when we have so huge a budget deficit?

## Slippery slope, related to excluded middle

- If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant.
- If the state prohibits abortion even in the ninth month, it will soon be telling us what to do with our bodies around the time of conception.

## Confusion of correlation and causation

- A survey shows that more college graduates are homosexual than those with lesser education; therefore education makes people gay.
- Andean earthquakes are correlated with closest approaches of the planet Uranus; therefore — despite the absence of any such correlation for the nearer, more massive planet Jupiter — the latter causes the former.

## Straw man

Caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack.

- Scientists suppose that living things simply fell together by chance — a formulation that willfully ignores the central Darwinian insight, that Nature ratchets up by saving what works and discarding what doesn’t.
— Environmentalists care more for snail darters and spotted owls than they do for people.

## Suppressed evidence, or half-truths

- An amazingly accurate and widely quoted “prophecy” of the assassination attempt on President Reagan is shown on television; but — an important detail — was it recorded before or after the event?
- These government abuses demand revolution, even if you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs. Yes, but is this likely to be a revolution in which far more people are killed than under the previous regime? What does the experience of other revolutions suggest? Are all revolutions against oppressive regimes desirable and in the interests of the people?

## Weasel words

E.g.:

- The separation of powers of the U.S. Constitution specifies that the United States may not conduct a war without a declaration by Congress.
- Elsewhere the USC gives Presidents control of foreign policy and the conduct of wars, which are potentially powerful tools for getting themselves re-elected.
- Presidents of either political party may therefore be tempted to arrange wars while waving the flag and calling the wars something else — “police actions,” “armed incursions,” “protective reaction strikes,” “pacification,” “safeguarding American interests,” and a wide variety of “operations,” such as “Operation Just Cause.” Euphemisms for war are one of a broad class of reinventions of language for political purposes. Talleyrand said, “An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public”

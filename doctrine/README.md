# waycalm doctrine
## Methods and precedents
Way Calm dogma sets out assumptions and imperatives that support __making reasoned choices__ to __promote calm collaboration__. Way Calm doctrine provides methods (stepwise goal-oriented behaviors) and precedents (starting points - dogma exemplified by instance).

### Methods
- A method is a qualified set of things and behaviors with reliable outcomes based on characteristics of the specific set members. Methods assume that people will use them but don't require it. Whoever uses a method is a member of the qualified set of things and might exhibit any of the set's behaviors.    
- Typically a method is arranged stepwise, but it can fork, and may be reentrant. Ideally a method includes one or more measures to objectify its success or failure and inform future iterations.
- A method has a label - short text identifying the method

# Way calm doctrine

Way calm [dogma](/dogma/README.md) sets out assumptions and imperatives that justify making reasoned choices promote calm. Way Calm doctrine provides methods (stepwise goal-oriented behaviors) and precedents (starting points - dogma exemplified by instance).

## What's a method?

A method is a qualified set of things' behaviors that produce reliable outcomes based on characteristics of the specific set members. Methods assume that people will use them but don't require it. Using a method indicates membership in of the qualified set of things and might exhibit any of the set's behaviors.

### Method qualities

- A method comprises a set of steps, but it can fork and loop.
- A method includes one or more dimensions to measure its outcomes and inform future iterations.
- A method has a name - short text that identifies the method unambiguously.

## What's a precedent?

A precedent is an historical instance of behavior that justifies the use of a method.
